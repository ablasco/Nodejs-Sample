This is just a sample app to play with:

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [express](http://expressjs.com/) as web server
* [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as NoSQL ODM
* [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) as view templating engine
* [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) as CSS engine
* [jQuery](http://jquery.org) and [jQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com/home) as client side technology

This *IS NOT* intended to be a catalogue of best practices. This is just
a very simple sample plenty of room for improvement. This modifications are inspired by following posts:

* [Mostrar avisos y errores con jQuery UI](http://blog.koalite.com/2011/10/mostrar-avisos-y-errores-con-jquery-ui/)


TO BE IMPROVED
--------------
* ~~Persistence. Remove mocks and try MongoDB+mongoose or other NoSQL database.~~
* ~~Better interface. Integrate some free template and improve it with "jQuery UI" widgets.~~
* ~~Complete CRUD. Implement missing features.~~
* Session control. Implement things like authentication, autorisation, etc., and mantain state via cookies.
* Unit tests. Maybe we could try "expresso".
* Better client architecture. Playing a bit with client frameworks to improve databinding and validation (Knockout, Backbone, etc).
