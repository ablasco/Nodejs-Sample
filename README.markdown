This is just a sample app to play with:

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [express](http://expressjs.com/) as web server
* [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as NoSQL ODM
* [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) as view engine
* [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) as CSS compiler
* [jQuery](http://jquery.org) as client side technology

This *IS NOT* intended to be a catalogue of best practices. This is just
a very simple sample plenty of room for improvement. 


TO BE IMPROVED
--------------
* ~~Persistence. Remove mocks and try MongoDB+mongoose or other NoSQL database.~~
* IN PROGRESS - Better interface. Integrate some free template and improve it with "jQuery UI" widgets.
* Session control. Implement things like authentication, autorisation, etc., and mantain state via cookies.
* Unit tests. Maybe we could try "expresso".
* Better client architecture. Playing a bit with client frameworks to improve databinding and validation (Knockout, Backbone, etc).
